Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
Example 1:

Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109

class Solution {
public:
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if(n == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int current = 1;
        int longest = 0;
        for(int i=1; i<n; i++){
            if(nums[i] != nums[i-1]){
                if(nums[i] == nums[i-1] + 1){
                    current++;
                }
                else{
                    longest = max(longest, current);
                    current = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return max(longest, current);
    }
};
